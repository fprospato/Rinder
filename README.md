# Rinder

- Go to Terminal and the project Repo:
- Install Cocoapods if you don't have it with `pod init`
- Then just run `pod install`
- Open `Rinder.xcworkspace` for the code. Don't use `Rinder.xcodeproj`
- Choose a simulator you wanna use (I tested with the iPhone 12 simulator) so prolly best to use that for UI consistency.
- Click the play button to run it

##Don't commit the Pods folder. Just commit anything u know u changed lol. Xcode sometimes shows random stuff that'll mess up the repo on our end if it's committed.
